*<<Every problem has an inefficient solution: if you like finding the worst one, this is the place to be>>*

This repo is a place where people spend their time on finding an inefficient solution to a well-known problem:
you may think that it's easy to code inefficiently, but here's the rules:

- the problem must be a well known problem, with **acknowledged** results in term of complexity (Space and Time);
- you cannot put **non-related instructions just to have a high Time/Space complexity**: e.g. you cannot use exponential for-  loops if you are not doing something really useful to find the solution of the problem;
- you cannot commit **bad code**: we are dealing with **inefficent code**.

**Rules of thumb**
- for each problem, a folder with the problem statement;
- for each solution, at least a single file;
- for each solution, you may want to specify the Time/Space complexity and where/how your genius came up;
- have fun.
